      <description>The Challenge A startup called Cope hired me to create a minimum viable product for their new idea — tracking mental health. It was the first project where I handled mobile app design, and I was very excited to learn the intricacies of the iOS platform.
My clients John and Kat have done some preliminary interviews with psychologists and psychiatrists to get their side of the picture. They have established a user persona, a business model canvas, and several startup prep work for the product to take off.</description>

      <title>360 Pro | Alexis Collado</title>

      <description>The Challenge Meeting with Chappy Callanta of 360 Pro led us to discover the root problem — the implementation of their performance testing framework. The gym uses a Numbers document on one iPad to record all tests, and relies on inefficient manual procedures to do the work. The document calculates a total pro score based on an athlete&amp;rsquo;s performance for specific exercises, but the coach using it has to refer to several norms before assigning a pro score.</description>

      <description>Context The Ateneo Junior Marketing Association always outsourced their website development to different organizations in the university. This year, they chose User Experience Society, the organization I founded to create a strong digital presence for their flagship event. TEDxADMU is acclaimed among the youth and is marked by the many up and coming trailblazers in the Philippine community.
The Challenge TEDxADMU always faced the same problems every year. How can we elevate the number of applications we receive?</description>

      <description>Facebook AI Research June 2020 - September 2020
Menlo Park, California
Research Intern
I was a member of the Text-to-Speech Synthesis team within Applied AI Speech. I developed deep neural network models for multi-speaker and multi-style controllable speech synthesis. I also designed end-to-end pipeline for joint training of speaker encoder model with text-to-speech synthesis (Tacotron2) model. Additionally, I developed a voice cloning toolkit for synthesizing speech of unseen speakers from a few reference audio samples.</description>
